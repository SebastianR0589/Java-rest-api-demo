# Java Spring Boot REST API Demo

This project is a backend-focused REST API built with Java Spring Boot to practice designing and implementing CRUD-based services, database integration and external API communication.

The application manages jogging activities submitted by users and persists them in a PostgreSQL database running inside a Docker container. Additionally, user-related data is retrieved via an external REST API using Spring’s REST client.

---

## Project Goals
- Design and implement a RESTful backend using Spring Boot  
- Implement full CRUD operations for domain entities  
- Integrate PostgreSQL using Docker for local development  
- Consume external REST APIs for user management  
- Structure a backend project following common Spring conventions  

---

## Features
- REST API for managing jogging activities  
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- PostgreSQL database integration via Docker  
- External API consumption for user-related data  
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)  

---

## Tech Stack
- Java Spring Boot  
- Maven  
- PostgreSQL  
- Docker
